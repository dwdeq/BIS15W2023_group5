## Introduction

We will be using data found on Kaggle. This data comes from a spreadsheet with information collected by players of the game Animal Crossing New Horizons. The data contains 30 csv files including information on villagers, clothing and collectibles. 

In our project we focused on the fish and bug data to create a guide to fishing and catching bugs for the game's museum. 


## Animal Crossing: New Horizons









```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
