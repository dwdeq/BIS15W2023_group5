## Introduction

We will be using data published on Kaggle. The data comes from a spreadsheet with information collected by players of the game Animal Crossing New Horizons. The data contains 30 csv files with information on villagers, clothing, and collectibles from the game. 

In our project we will focus on the fish and insect csv files to create a guide to fishing and catching bugs for the game's museum. 


## Animal Crossing: New Horizons
Animal Crossing: New Horizons is described by Wikipedia as a "social simulation game." Developed and published by Nintendo in 2020, players control a character who moves to a deserted island where they accomplish tasks, build and customize the island, gather and craft items, and create a community of anthropomorphic animals. 

The fish and insect data that we use in our project are some of the season and progress dependent aspects of the game, meaning that some of the organisms only appear for a limited time of the game's year, and that some of the organisms are only unlocked as the player progresses through the game. 

Fish and insects are organisms that can be caught in the game and sold to the museum that serves as a sort of island archive, for collection and display of all of the player's collectibles.

## Cleaning the data

Names: janitor work

Seasonality: 
To work with the varying organisms that can be caught during the different months, (and to account for hemispheres in the game), we cleaned the data so that the catch times were organized by hour of the day, by each month.
